  *<summary> 2. Audit Goals </summary>*
 
It should be noted that the scope is not constant from audit to audit. However, once the scope of the audit is
clearly defined, only items within scope should be audited. In this scenario, the scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures.

* Botium Toys internal IT audit will assess the following:
 * Current user permissions set in the following systems: 
    * Accounting, 
    * End Point Detection, 
    * Firewalls, 
    * Intrusion Detection System, 
    * Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
 * Current implemented controls in the following systems: 
    * Accounting, 
    * End Point Detection, 
    * Firewalls, 
    * Intrusion Detection System, 
    * Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
  * Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: 
    * Accounting, 
    * End Point Detection, 
    * Firewalls, 
    * Intrusion Detection System, 
    * Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
  * Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place align with necessary compliance requirements.
  * Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.

  *<summary> 3. Risk Assessment </summary>*
  * Assets managed by the IT Department include:
    * <ins>On-premises equipment for in-office business needs</ins>
    * <ins>Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones),</ins>
remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations,
surveillance cameras, etc.
    * <ins> Management of systems, software, and services:</ims> accounting,
telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory
management
    * Internet access
    * Internal network
    * Vendor access management
    * Data center hosting services
    * Data retention and storage
    * Badge readers
    * Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring
  
## Risk description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does
not have the proper controls in place and may not be compliant with U.S. and
international regulations and standards.
  
## Control best practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to
dedicate resources to managing assets. Additionally, they will need to determine the
impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

## Risk score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of
controls and adherence to necessary compliance regulations and standards.
  
## Additional comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT
department does not know which assets would be lost. The likelihood of a lost asset or
fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the
necessary controls in place and is not adhering to required regulations and standards
related to keeping customer data private.

  <summary> 5. Compliance Checklist </summary>

  
## <b>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)</b>

The FERC-NERC regulation applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. Organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. Organizations are legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standards (CIP) defined by the FERC. 
   
### <b>Explanation: </b>
   
A fictitious company like Botium Toys, if operating within the jurisdiction of the United States and involved in the energy sector, could potentially be affected by the regulations and standards enforced by FERC and NERC. However, it's important to note that Botium Toys, as described in the scenario, is a toy development and sales company, which may not directly fall under the scope of FERC and NERC regulations unless they have specific energy-related operations.
FERC's regulations primarily focus on the transmission and wholesale sale of electricity and natural gas, ensuring the reliability, security, and competitiveness of energy markets. If Botium Toys were to engage in activities related to energy generation, transmission, or wholesale trading of electricity or natural gas, they would need to comply with FERC's regulations applicable to those activities.
   
NERC's reliability standards are mandatory for entities involved in the operation, planning, and maintenance of the bulk power system in North America. These standards cover areas such as system planning, operations, critical infrastructure protection, and cybersecurity. If Botium Toys were operating critical infrastructure directly related to the bulk power system or were a participant in the electric utility industry, they would need to comply with NERC's reliability standards applicable to their operations.
However, it's worth noting that the scenario describes Botium Toys as a toy development and sales company, which suggests that their primary focus is not energy-related operations. Therefore, unless the scenario provides additional context about their involvement in the energy sector, it's unlikely that Botium Toys would be directly subject to FERC and NERC regulations.
For the Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standards (CIP) defined by the FERC. Botium Toys does not have a critical asset like Transmission network which its failure could affect a large population. But Botium Toys can align itself with other regulations like NIST CSF.
   
## <b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b>

GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. citizens’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. Additionally, if a breach occurs and a E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed within 72 hours of the incident.
   
### <b>Explanation: </b>

The GDPR establishes a set of rules for how personal data of individuals within the EU should be collected, processed, and stored.
GDPR applies to ALL organizations globally, as long as the org stores or processes personal data of EU citizens or residents.
The requirements of DGPR for EU and outside of EU territory has strict requirements that protect the customer, like informing the customer within 72hours of the incident.
The other consideration is to have some responsible for GDPR implementation or compliance in the company to avoid penalties and fines. GDPR fines can be up to €20 million or 4% of a company's global annual revenue, whichever is higher.
The severity of the violation, whether it was intentional or accidental, and the steps taken to mitigate harm to individuals are all factors that are considered in determining the amount of a fine. The type of data involved, whether it's sensitive or not, and whether it was encrypted or otherwise protected also factor into the calculation.


## <b>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</b>

PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. 

### <b>Explanation: </b>

From the scenario given, it should be noted that Botium Toys has Growing online presence, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad, which means the company collect the payment online using shopping carts, whereby the customers may be paying using different payment methods including debit cards, credit cards and paypal to mention a few. The company will therefore have to abide with PCI DSS – Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards because the CDE – Cardholder Device Environment which is the website of the company will have to be designed in a way that complies with the standards set.
   
* Key components of the PCI DSS include:
     * Build and maintain a secure network.
     * Protect cardholder data.
     * Maintain a vulnerability management program.
     * Implement strong access control measures.
     * Regularly monitor and test networks.
     * Maintain an information security policy.

## <b>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</b>
 
HIPAA is a federal law established in 1996 to protect U.S. patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. Organizations have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach. 

### <b>Explanation: </b>
   
Botium Toys being an U.S. company has a duty to comply with HIPAA in order to protect Health Data related to its employees. The policies of many companies with regard to processing of personal health data provides that: employees are to provide sick leave to support their absence from work due to sickness. Taking this policy into consideration, the company has to processes the sick leaves in a manner that will not reveal the patient data to unauthorized individuals. Moreover If the company has a health department which has an in-house clinic, the nurse or occupational health and safety officer working in that office or clinic will have to preserve the integrity of patient records kept in his her office at all times. 
The other requirement is to comply with <ins>electronic protected health information – <b>ePHI</b></ins>
Botium Toys may become HITRUST certified, organizations can demonstrate compliance with HIPAA regulations, as well as other applicable regulations and standards.
   
<ins>HITRUST certification</ins> involves a rigorous assessment and validation process that evaluates an organization's security controls and risk management practices.
By achieving HITRUST certification, organizations can improve their overall security posture and demonstrate their commitment to protecting sensitive healthcare data.
The penalties that goes with violating HIPAA, HITRST or ePHI is refered to as The HIPAA Breach Notification Rule which requires covered entities to promptly notify individuals, the government, and sometimes the media in the event of a breach of protected health information. Fines due to breach range from as low as $100 to $1,500,000
   
## <b>System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)</b>

The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels. They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

### <b>Explanation: </b>
   
System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports are independent assessments conducted by a certified public accountant (CPA) to evaluate the controls and processes of service organizations. SOC reports provide valuable information to customers and stakeholders about the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of the services provided by the organization.
   
<ins>SOC Type 1: A SOC Type 1 report</ins> evaluates the design and implementation of controls at a specific point in time. It provides an overview of the service organization's control environment and assesses whether the controls are suitably designed to achieve the specified control objectives. SOC Type 1 reports are useful for organizations and their customers to gain confidence in the service provider's control environment.
   
<ins>SOC Type 2: A SOC Type 2 report</ins> goes beyond the design assessment of controls and evaluates the operating effectiveness of the controls over a specified period of time. It includes a detailed examination of the controls, their implementation, and their effectiveness in achieving the control objectives. 
SOC Type 2 reports provide a higher level of assurance as they demonstrate that the controls have been tested and are operating effectively over a period of time (usually six to 12 months).
   
With regard to Botium Toys, it has been stated from the risk assessment that there is inadequate management of assets, poor control and it is not in compliance with U.S and international standard, therefore for now it would be proper to undertake SOC type one which will entail evaluation the design and implementation of controls for the company. This will be followed by SOC type 2 which will be a detailed examination of the controls, their implementation, and their effectiveness in achieving the control objectives. 
   
By undergoing a SOC examination, Botium Toys can provide transparency and assurance to its customers regarding the security and integrity of its systems and processes. This can help build trust, demonstrate compliance with relevant regulations, and differentiate the company from competitors in the market.
